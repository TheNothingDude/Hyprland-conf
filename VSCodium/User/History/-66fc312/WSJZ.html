        <h1>What is Environmental protection</h1>

        <p>Environmental protection is the practice of protecting the natural environment by individuals, groups and governments. Its objectives are to conserve natural resources and the existing natural environment and, where it is possible, to repair damage and reverse trends.
            Environmental Protection includes programs and services that are aimed at reducing risks to the environment from contaminants such as hazardous materials and wastes, fuels, and oils.
