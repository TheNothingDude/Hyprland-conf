            <h1>What is Environmental protection?</h1>
            <h2>Definition <sup><a href="https://www.yourdictionary.com/environmental-protection"></a>1</sup></h2>
            <p>Environmental protection is the practice of protecting the natural environment by individuals, groups and governments. Its objectives are to conserve natural resources and the existing natural environment and, where it is possible, to repair damage and reverse trends.</p>

                    <h3>Voluntary environmental agreements <sup><a title=""></a>2</sup></h3>
                    <h3>Voluntary environmental agreements <sup><a title=""></a>2</sup></h3>
                    <p>In industrial countries, voluntary environmental agreements often provide a platform for companies to be recognized for moving beyond the minimum regulatory standards and thus support the development of the best environmental practice.
                        For instance, in India, Environment Improvement Trust (EIT) has been working for environmental and forest protection since 1998.</p>

                    <h3>Ecosystems approach</h3>
                    <p>An ecosystems approach to resource management and environmental protection aims to consider the complex interrelationships of an entire ecosystem in decision-making rather than simply responding to specific issues and challenges. Ideally, the decision-making processes under such an approach would be a collaborative approach to planning and decision-making that involves a broad range of stakeholders across all relevant governmental departments, as well as industry representatives, environmental groups, and community. This approach ideally supports a better exchange of information, development of conflict-resolution strategies and improved regional conservation.</p>

                    <h3>International environmental agreements</h3>
                    <p>Many of the earth's resources are especially vulnerable because they are influenced by human impacts across different countries. As a result of this, many attempts are made by countries to develop agreements that are signed by multiple governments to prevent damage or manage the impacts of human activity on natural resources. This can include agreements that impact factors such as climate, oceans, rivers and air pollution. These international environmental agreements are sometimes legally binding documents that have legal implications when they are not followed and, at other times, are more agreements in principle or are for use as codes of conduct.</p>
